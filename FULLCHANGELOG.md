## [0.3.7] - 2025-09-20

### Added
- First-run install folder setup: prompts user to select a folder and saves it to `install_folder.json`.
- `Change Folder` button in settings updates `install_folder.json` without triggering on page load.
- `install_folder.json` now stores absolute paths relative to the launcher directory.
- Default folder dialog now opens in the launcher folder for predictable behavior.
- `install_folder_var` properly uses `CTk.StringVar` with the main root to prevent Tkinter errors.

### Fixed
- Issue where `Change Folder` function ran immediately when loading the settings page.
- Tkinter `StringVar` initialization error (‚ÄúToo early to create variable‚Äù) when loading install path.
- Inconsistent install folder detection when running from PyCharm versus direct launch.

### Changed
- Launcher now reads and writes install folder paths in a central JSON file next to `launcher.py`.
- Folder selection now defaults to the launcher directory rather than the current working directory.

## [0.3.5] - 2025-09-20
### Added
- New **update check system** that fetches the latest version from GitHub (`version.json`) and prompts the user if a new version is available.
- **Update popup window** (modal) that always appears in front of the launcher, giving the choice to update now or later.
- Added **changelog support** via GitHub `CHANGELOG.md` format.

### Changed
- The **update process** now restarts the launcher automatically after downloading and replacing the file.
- Improved **settings.json auto-sync**: missing keys are now automatically added with default values.
- Consistent use of **grid/pack separation** in UI pages to avoid geometry manager conflicts.

### Fixed
- Fixed `NameError: show_update_page not defined` by implementing a proper popup function.
- Fixed issue where `version.json` returned incorrect values due to formatting.
- Fixed wrong version display inside **settings page** (now correctly shows the launcher version).
- Fixed broken **changelog link** to ensure proper GitHub navigation.
- Prevented update popup from appearing when `"coding": "1"` is set in `settings.json`.
